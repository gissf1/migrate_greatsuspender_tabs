# Migrate The Great Suspender Tabs

This is a quick shell script using xdotool and xclip to easily migrate open Google Chrome tabs that were previously saved by The Great Suspender plugin (https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender) and migrate them to The Marvellous Suspender (https://github.com/gioxx/MarvellousSuspender).

With a small code change, this same code can be used to migrate them to another plugin, but that change is left as an exercise for slightly more advanced users.
